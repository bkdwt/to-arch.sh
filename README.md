### This converts your Manjaro or EndeavourOS installation into Arch Linux while preserving the uselrand and packages.<br>This script is inspired by [this gist](https://gist.github.com/mariuszkurek/bff8a821076f5406b15fe9be528957b6/).<br>
By the way, the makefile of this script assumes that you use GNU coreutils. If you're a pervert who uses something like BSD coreutils, please tell me, I'll ignore you.
