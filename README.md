# to-arch.sh — Manjaro/EndeavourOS becomes Arch
## Please be goddamn sure I have no responsibility for a non bootable system. It's your choice to run something like this, right?
![](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/kskeigrshi/to-arch.sh/total)<br>
This converts your Manjaro or EndeavourOS installation into Arch Linux.<br>This script is inspired by [this gist](https://gist.github.com/mariuszkurek/bff8a821076f5406b15fe9be528957b6/).<br>
By the way, the makefile of this script assumes that you use GNU coreutils. If you're a pervert who uses something like BSD coreutils, please tell me.

## How to use
Go to the [Releases tab](https://github.com/kskeigrshi/to-arch.sh/releases/latest).
<br>Download `to-arch.sh` by clicking on it.
Run
```
bash to-arch.sh
```

Maybe you have some bird ideas.

Maybe that's the best thing you can do.
